# Azure Infrastructure with Terraform

This repository contains a complete, modular Terraform codebase for provisioning secure Azure infrastructure for external web applications.

## Architecture Overview

### Design Decisions

**Compute Choice: Azure App Services**
- **Simplified Management**: No need to manage underlying VMs, OS updates, or scaling infrastructure
- **Built-in Security**: Integrated with Azure AD, managed certificates, and automatic patching
- **Easy Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand with minimal configuration
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-per-use model with built-in load balancing and SSL termination
- **Developer Friendly**: Direct integration with CI/CD pipelines and multiple deployment slots

**Multi-Tier Architecture**
- **Frontend Tier**: Public-facing App Service for web application
- **Backend Tier**: Private App Service for APIs with VNet integration
- **Data Tier**: Azure SQL Database and Blob Storage with private endpoints

### Security Features

- **Network Segmentation**: Separate subnets for each tier with NSG rules
- **Managed Identities**: Eliminates need for storing credentials
- **RBAC**: Least-privilege access control throughout the infrastructure
- **Private Endpoints**: Database and storage accessible only through private network
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive access policies on all resources

## Environment Support

The infrastructure supports multiple environments through:
- Environment-specific variable files (`environments/cde.tfvars`, `environments/prod.tfvars`)
- Reusable modules with parameterized configurations
- Consistent naming conventions with environment prefixes

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated
2. **Terraform** >= 1.0 installed
3. **Azure Subscription** with appropriate permissions
4. **Service Principal** or **Managed Identity** for Terraform execution

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Initialize

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd terraform-azure-infrastructure
terraform init
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy and customize the environment file:
```bash
cp environments/cde.tfvars.example environments/cde.tfvars
# Edit the file with your specific values
```

### 3. Plan and Apply

```bash
# Review the plan
terraform plan -var-file="environments/cde.tfvars"

# Apply the infrastructure
terraform apply -var-file="environments/cde.tfvars"
```

### 4. Access Outputs

```bash
# Get important outputs
terraform output app_service_urls
terraform output database_connection_info
```

## Environment Configuration

### CDE Environment
- Smaller SKUs for cost optimization
- Relaxed some security rules for development access
- Single availability zone deployment

### Production Environment
- Production-grade SKUs with high availability
- Strict security policies
- Multi-zone deployment for resilience
- Enhanced monitoring and backup policies

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**: All resources deployed in private subnets where possible
2. **Identity Management**: Managed identities used throughout for service-to-service authentication
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit for all data stores
4. **Access Control**: RBAC policies enforce least-privilege access
5. **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor and Log Analytics integration for security monitoring

## Deployment Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Private Endpoint DNS Resolution
**Issue**: Private endpoints require proper DNS configuration for name resolution.
**Solution**: Implemented Azure Private DNS zones with automatic registration.

### Challenge 2: App Service VNet Integration
**Issue**: Backend App Service needs to communicate with private resources.
**Solution**: Used VNet integration feature to place App Service in private subnet.

### Challenge 3: Cross-Environment Resource Naming
**Issue**: Ensuring unique resource names across environments.
**Solution**: Implemented consistent naming convention with environment prefixes and random suffixes.

## Feedback Questions

1. **Monitoring Strategy**: Should we implement Azure Application Insights and Log Analytics workspace per environment or shared?

2. **Backup Strategy**: What's the preferred backup retention policy for different environments?

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Do you need Terraform state stored in Azure Storage with state locking?

4. **Compliance Requirements**: Are there specific compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.) we need to address?

5. **Disaster Recovery**: Should we implement cross-region disaster recovery for production?

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement Application Insights and alerting
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Create Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions pipeline
3. **Security Scanning**: Integrate Terraform security scanning tools
4. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for common operational tasks
5. **Testing**: Implement infrastructure testing with Terratest
